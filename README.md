# RNAscope quantification

Welcome to the RNAscope quantification project! This code is being 
developed in collaboration with Connor McNulty and the Baratta lab at CU 
Boulder.

This project has two goals:
1. Identify GFP labeled cells
2. Identify and count the number of cells with RNA labeling.

## Installation and Usage

### Required MATLAB toolboxes

This project requires the following MATLAB toolboxes to be installed:
* Image Processing Toolbox

### Additional toolboxes

This project also requires the following custom toolboxes:
* [ND2SDK Matlab toolbox](https://github.com/jwtay1/nd2sdk-MATLAB)
  
  This toolbox is required to read in ND2 files into MATLAB. The 



1. **Download** the code by clicking on the blue Code button above, then 
   selecting "Download ZIP".
2. **Extract** the ZIP file into a directory accessible by MATLAB (e.g.
   in Documents/MATLAB). Navigate to this folder in MATLAB.
3. **Add the processing folder to the MATLAB path** by right-clicking on
   the ``processing`` folder, then select "Add to Path" > "Selected Folders
   and Subfolders".
